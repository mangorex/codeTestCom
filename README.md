It is about a development in C# with .net 6 in a console application

### Architecture and technologies used
* **Windows 10**
* **Net core 6**
* Visual studio 2022 community Edition

### Points completed
* **Code in english with so love and not so bad style of code (I think)**
* Console application
~~* Use of TDD~~
~~* Simple example of parallelism with 2 threads~~
~~* Reading the xml file simulating the reception of the api from the partners~~
    
### Things to improve:
* **Code with the best style of code (I think)**

So **many thanks to the people** who have given me the test **to prove myself**
